This project runs a daily GitHub Action that updates a timestamp file to keep my contribution graph beautifully green. ðŸŒ±

No code. No features. Just pure, automated activity.

## ðŸ¤– What it does

- Runs once a day via cron
- Updates a `last-updated.txt` file with the current UTC time
- Commits and pushes the change (if any)
- Keeps my streak alive like a champ

## ðŸ”§ Powered by

- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- A single line of text, rewritten daily
- A mild obsession with green contribution squares ðŸŸ©

### ðŸ“… Last updated:

> Why?  
> Because streaks matter. Even if no one knows what you're streaking about.
